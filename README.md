# Home Assistant Go-Keyboard
Use a regular wireless Numpad to control Home Assistant (this is a bit niche)

# Overview

I have Home Assistant setup in my house to control pretty much everything.

I have tablets mounted on the wall with a beautiful clear theme that allows for lots of interactive control.

The problem is, my wife and kids hate using them!

After some behavioral testing I discovered that they REALLY like pressing physical buttons to activate stuff. For my testing I used a cheap 2.4Ghz wireless Numpad from Amazon, it was very inexpensive at Â£5.20 delivered.

I already had a Raspberry Pi in the house acting as a Zigbee gateway, so I connected the Numpad's wireless USB receiver to the Pi and coded a simple utility to intercept the Numpad button presses and forward them to Home Assistant via MQTT.

This works far better than I expected and it immediately gained approval from the family, so I extended the utility to add some additional features such as double-click and long-press detection.





Pros
- wireless dongle has a range of at least 20 meters
- battery life using the 1xAAA cell is measured in years
- super inexpensive
- Coded in Go, single tiny binary with no dependencies, tested on ARM and x86 linux

Cons
- Keycaps are not replicable
- You need a device to plug the receiver into that can run a tiny utility in the background (I'm using a RPi1)
