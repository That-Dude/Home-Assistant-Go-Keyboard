# Home Assistant Go-Keyboard
Use a regular wireless Keyboard or Numpad to control Home Assistant

# Overview
I have Home Assistant setup in my house to control a bunch of stuff. I have a tablet on the wall with a beautful clear theme that allows for lots of interactive control but my wife and kids hate using it.

After some human behavioral testing I discovered that they really REALLY like pressing physical buttons to activate stuff. As a quick test I grabbed a cheap 2.4Ghz wireless numpad from Amazon (Â£5.20 delivered).
